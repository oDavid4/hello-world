# hello-world
training for github
Preparing for what I hope to be a pathway to helping with Adafruit/CircuitPython
My first experience using Atom/GitHub(local) has not been pleasant, but...
I'm slowly learning features and will persist
Now I've merged the first branch from Atom with the master by doing so on github.com
This time, I will merge from Atom
